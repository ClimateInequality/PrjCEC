This is a website for [Feng et al. (2024)](https://szkaifeng.github.io/pdf/FengLBHWChinaChildrenHeat1990t2020.pdf).

Code for generating the statistics shown in tables and figures are stored in the [R-script](https://github.com/ClimateInequality/PrjCEC/tree/main/R-script) folder, and code and output for visualizaing and tabularization are stored in the [res](https://github.com/ClimateInequality/PrjCEC/tree/main/res) folder.
