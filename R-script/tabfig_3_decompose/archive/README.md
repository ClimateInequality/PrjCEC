Retired files. Initially, following <https://github.com/ClimateInequality/PrjCEC/issues/38>, planned to have separate national and regional tables. Then, decided to have joint tables with multiple regions, and a national table. Finally combined all tables together, national and regional in one.

This folder contains prior archive files:

- Initial national table generator: `R-script/tabfig_3_decompose/archive/ffs_pirecec_tf_decompose_national_tab_a.R`
- Regional tables separately: `R-script/tabfig_3_decompose/archive/ffs_pirecec_tf_decompose_regional_tab_b_sepregional.R`
- Joint regional one table generator: `R-script/tabfig_3_decompose/archive/ffs_pirecec_tf_decompose_regional_tab_b_jntregional.R`
