# Day time hours only analysis

In this folder, we first generate from the full day hours file day time only hours files, and then we generate 2020 vs 1990 differences for the average individual (child) using day time hours only.

See part 1 of <https://github.com/ClimateInequality/PrjCEC/issues/35>. And part 2 of <https://github.com/ClimateInequality/PrjCEC/issues/34>.
